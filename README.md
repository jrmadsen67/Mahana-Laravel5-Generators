# Mahana Laravel5 Generators
Laravel5 Generator generator extensions

This is currently a work in progress to support https://github.com/jrmadsen67/MahanaGeneratorScaffolding

Currently, only Model Generator is created. It can be used from the commandline as:

`artisan mahana:model Book [--table=books] [--primary=book_id] [--fillable=name,author_id] [--dates=published_date,renewed_date]`

If this interests you or you would like to give feedback, please feel free to open an Issue and make whatever comments you have there.

Thanks!
